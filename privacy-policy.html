                            <strong>COMPANY WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
                            <br />Dbotica (A unit of Histobiotic healthcare Private Ltd.. (“Company” “we”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy practices (“Privacy Policy”). By using the Company services, or visiting the Company website (collectively, the “Services”), you accept the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.<u><br /></u><strong>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</strong>
                            <br />This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don&rsquo;t own or control, or people that we don&rsquo;t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. This Privacy Policy does not cover information collected via third party mobile applications which utilize Company&rsquo;s development platform (“Apps”).
                            <br />
                            <br /><strong>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?</strong>
                            <br />Information You Provide to Us:We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for google or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may communicate with you if you&rsquo;ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you&rsquo;ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the emails.Information Collected AutomaticallyWhenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you&rsquo;re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device&rsquo;s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible. Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track PolicyThrough cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.
                            <br />
                            <br /><strong>HOW DOES COMPANY USE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong>
                            <br />We only use your Personal Information internally to: (i) provide Services to our customers and (ii) further develop and improve such Services.<strong><br /><br />WILL COMPANY SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</strong>

In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred.
